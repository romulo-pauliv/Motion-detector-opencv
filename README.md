### Features 
- The motion detection project with opencv aims to learn in computer vision. The method employed uses only the python-opencv import with image pre-processing and a frame differentiation strategy;
- Learning is divided into importing and exporting data in .csv and computer vision;
- The project is good for understanding the relationship of external files to code, such as folders, files, and images.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have already installed the imports through requirements.txt. In your IDE's console, do:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After installing the requirements, pay attention to the `motion-detector.csv` file and the `MotionDetectionImage` folder. They will be needed for the code to work.
